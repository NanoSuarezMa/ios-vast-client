# IOS Vast Client

IOS Vast Client is a Swift Framework which implements the [VAST 3.0](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/digital-video-ad-serving-template-vast-3-0/) spec.

This project is ongoing and in very early stages of development. As this project is being developed we will only target a subset of the VAST spec to meet our immediate needs. We do not recommend to use this library at this time.
